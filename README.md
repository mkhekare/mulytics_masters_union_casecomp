# Step-by-Step Analysis for Lead Installation Forecasting

## Objective
This analysis aims to address the challenges faced by a leading broadband provider in optimizing lead conversion processes. The goal is to:

- **Optimize the Lead Funnel:**
  - Segment customers to identify high-conversion leads.
  - Allocate marketing budgets efficiently.
  - Prioritize high-potential leads for follow-ups.

- **Develop a Predictive Model:**
  - Identify features impacting lead conversions.
  - Build models to predict lead installation success.

## Overview of Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values in critical columns like `days_to_accept` and `days_to_install_request`.
- Renamed columns for better readability.
- Applied encoding (One-Hot and Label Encoding) for categorical variables.
- Balanced the target variable using SMOTE to handle class imbalance.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distributions using histograms and countplots.
- Analyzed correlations between numerical variables and the target using heatmaps.
- Highlighted insights like key metrics (`marketing_spend_inr`, `days_to_qualify`) that influence conversions.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Built and compared multiple models:
  - **Random Forest** for robust feature importance.
  - **XGBoost** for handling complex patterns.
  - **Voting Classifier** to combine strengths of multiple models.
  
- Evaluated models using:
  - Classification Reports for precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - ROC-AUC Score to assess overall performance.
  - Confusion Matrices for understanding true/false positives and negatives.

### 4. Feature Importance and Recommendations
- Identified top features like `days_to_install_request` and `marketing_spend_inr`.
- Provided actionable strategies to prioritize resources and improve marketing efficiency.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `imblearn`.
  
### Preprocessing:
- Missing value imputation.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Balancing classes with SMOTE.

### Visualization:
- Heatmaps, countplots, histograms, and barplots.

### Machine Learning Models:
- Random Forest, XGBoost, and Voting Classifier.

## Key Deliverables

  - Insights into lead behaviors and operational metrics.
  
- **Feature Importance Analysis:**
  - Identification of critical predictors for conversions.
  
- **Predictive Model Performance:**
  - Models evaluated on precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
  
- **Actionable Recommendations:**
  - Strategies for improving lead prioritization and marketing efficiency.
